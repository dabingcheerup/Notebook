1. [Installing Bootstrap 4 Tutorial](https://coursetro.com/posts/design/72/Installing-Bootstrap-4-Tutorial) Errors and Solutions that I met when I tried to install bootstrap 1\) jQuery not uploaded diy: npm install jquery --save 2\) Popper not installed: npm install popper.js --save 3\) gulpfile.js node\_modules/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.min.js not from node\_modules/popper.js/dist/popper.min.js as this gives the unexpected token error in chrome. 4\) Gulp not working: npm install -g minimatch \(Enter\) npm install -g graceful-fs \(Enter\) npm link gulp \(Enter\)

   I also had to restart my computer after installing node.js and again for Git Bash gulp then works as it does in your demonstration.
