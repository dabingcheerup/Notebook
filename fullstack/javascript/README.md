The Internet is the network, is the hardware. The World Wide Web we can think of as the software. The World Wide Web is an application that is running on the network, on top of the Internet. The Internet is providing the infrastructure that the World Wide Web is using that infrastructure to transfer transmit data

1. So what is the World Wide Web?

   _The **World Wide Web** is an **application** that runs on top of the Internet. It combines various protocols to allow for communication and transfer of data between machines._

The web is composed of documents that are linked to each other. Now, originally, the World Wide Web was designed to allow for this **access to all these documents and to link them together**. And that we could get from one document to another using something known as the web browser.

I mentioned before that the Internet is a graph where the nodes are the devices and the edges are the physical connections between them. The World Wide Web is also a graph that we can say is perhaps overlaid on top of the Internet. Where now the **nodes** are **the documents or the content or the resources**.And the **edges** are these **virtual links between them** where I can get from one to another, for instance, in this diagram at the bottom of this slide.

If I'm looking at this page on the Internet of this content or document on the Internet, I can follow these links to other pages or documents or contents and from here I can go up to here and here and and so on, and now there's also a graph.

1. How do we identify or address content on the World Wide Web?

   Generally speaking, every piece of content has what's known as a **URI**, or uniform resource identifier, that's just **a unique address on the World Wide Web**. The **URL**, or uniform resource locator, is **a type of URI**, it's a type of address that specifies not only the location on the World Wide Web, but **the protocol or the mechanism for accessing it**.

Here's an example of a URL that we're, of course, very familiar with. The first part of the URL is the **protocol**. The protocol just explains the structure of communication between devices, and we're going to look at this particular protocol http in a little more detail later in this lesson. The next part is the **host name**. The host name is the name of some computer that's on the World Wide Web. **Part of that is the domain name**. The domain name is a group of computers or a group of addresses that **belong usually to some specific organization**. On that computer, on that host, somewhere on the World Wide Web, is the content, and that content is usually accessed via some file path. And following that might be **some parameters or some queries, some data that we want to send to the host** that has that content before we get back that content.

We can consider contents on the World Wide Web to fall into two categories. 1. One is the **static content**. Static just means it does not change, that no matter who looks at it, no matter when they look at it, it always looks the same. The technologies used to create static content are **HTML and CSS**, which we're going to see in the first part of this course. 2. Now the other type of content that we see on the World Wide Web is known as **dynamic content**. Dynamic content is the content that changes as you're looking at it. It could be generated based on who you are, it could be generated based on something that's happened, something that you've done within the application. And the technology that's used for dynamic content is **JavaScript**.
