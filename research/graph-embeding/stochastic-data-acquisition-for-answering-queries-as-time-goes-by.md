# Stochastic Data Acquisition for Answering Queries as Time Goes by

**New Vacabularies:**

extensible, incorporate, coalesces, negligible, exploiting, drift, outperform

**Q:**

1. Machine Learning technique: Reinforcement Learning. Definition? \[22\]
2. Mathematical Framework: Partially Observable Markov Decision Process? \[16\]
3. Locality Sensitive Hashing \(LSH\) \[19\]
4. MinHash is a LSH mechanism based on this metric \[10\]
5. model-free Q-learning \[15\]

**Contributions**  
1. Goal: To study the sequential data acquisition problem \(Sec 2\)  
2. Approach1: use reinforcement learning and the POMDP model \(Sec 3\)

```text
a. Coalescing the states in POMDP with two means of locality sensitive hashing (Sec 4 and 5)
```

\3. Approach2: using the model-free Qlearning to avoid the overhead of re-learning of model parameters for dynamic environments \(Section 6\)
