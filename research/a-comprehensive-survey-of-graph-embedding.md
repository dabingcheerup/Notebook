####Graph Embeding
#####Definition

By representing a graph as a (or a set of) low dimensional vector(s), graph algorithms can then be computed efficiently.

Types of Graph
homogeneous graph, heterogeneous graph, attribute graph, etc So 
The input of graph embedding: varies in different scenarios. 
The output of graph embedding: is a low-dimensional vector representing a part of the graph (or a whole graph).

The problem of graph embedding 
is related to two traditional research problems, 
1. i.e., graph analytics [8] and
2. representation learning [9]. 

graph embedding aims to represent a graph as low dimensional vectors while
the graph structures are preserved.

graph analytics aims to mine useful information from graph data.

representation learning obtains data representations that make it easier to extract useful information when building classifiers or other predictors [9].
