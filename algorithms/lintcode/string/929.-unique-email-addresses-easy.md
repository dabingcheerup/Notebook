# 929. Unique Email Addresses Easy

### Desc

Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.

For example, in `alice@leetcode.com`, `alice` is the local name, and `leetcode.com` is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain `'.'`s or `'+'`s.

If you add periods \(`'.'`\) between some characters in the **local name** part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.  For example, `"alice.z@leetcode.com"`and `"alicez@leetcode.com"` forward to the same email address.  \(Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.\)

If you add a plus \(`'+'`\) in the **local name**, everything after the first plus sign will be **ignored**. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example `m.y+name@email.com` will be forwarded to `my@email.com`.  \(Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.\)

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given a list of `emails`, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails? 

#### **Example 1:**

```text
Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails
```

#### **Note:**

* `1 <= emails[i].length <= 100`
* `1 <= emails.length <= 100`
* Each `emails[i]` contains exactly one `'@'`character.

============================================================================

### **Analysis:**

1. before @: 
   1. delete dot
   2. delete everything after the first plus \(including plus\)
2. after @:
3. the email address should be same if these two parts are the same

### **Pseudocode:**

```text
// traverse the email list to transfer each email
int unique_num;
for each email in the list:
    //split the string by '@', then keep the right part in <right>, 
    split the left part by '+', keep the left part, and then ingore '.'
    concatenate <left>@<right> and store it into a set <unique>
    new set unique;
    
    String[] parts = email.split('@');
    string[] keep = parts[0].split('+');
    string left = keep[0].delete('.');
    string right = parts[1];
    string update = left + '@' + right;
    unique.add(update);

// count the number of unique transferred email address
unique_num = unique.length();
return unique_num;
```

### **KEY!!!**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Solution**

不用String的split方法，因为结果会存在array中，所以要在array和String中转换不方便。直接用indexOf\(\)和substring\(a, b\)来处理

**Grammar**

String:

1. [int indexOf\(int ch\)](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-string-indexof)
2. [String substring\(int beginIndex, int endIndex\)](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-string-substring)

Hashset:

1. Set&lt;String&gt; name = new HashSet\(\);
2. 
{% endhint %}

### **Analysis**

For each email address, convert it to the _canonical_ address that actually receives the mail. This involves a few steps:

* Separate the email address into a `local` part and the `rest` of the address.
* If the `local` part has a `'+'` character, remove it and everything beyond it from the `local`part.
* Remove all the zeros from the `local` part.
* The canonical address is `local + rest`.

After, we can count the number of unique canonical addresses with a `Set` structure.



```text
class Solution {
    public int numUniqueEmails(String[] emails) {
        Set<String> seen = new Hashset();
        for (String email: emails) {
            int i = email.indexOf('@');
            String local = email.substring(0, i);
            String rest = email.substring(i);
            if (local.contains("+")){
                local = local.substring(0, local.indexOf('+'));
            }
            local = local.replaceAll('.','');
            seen.add(local+rest);
        }
        return seen.size;
    }
}
```
