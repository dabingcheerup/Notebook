# Postman

Postman is a plugin in Google Chrome, and it can be used for testing API services. It is a powerful HTTP client to test web services. For manual or exploratory testing, Postman is a good choice for testing API.

1. With Postman, almost all modern web API data can be extracted
2. You can write Boolean tests within Postman Interface
3. You can create a collection of REST calls and save each call as part of a collection for execution in future

   Unlike CURL, it is not a command line based tool, which makes this tool hassle free of pasting text into command line window

4. For transmitting and receiving REST information, Postman is more reliable
